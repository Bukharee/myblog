        2.19. Writing a Simple Recursive Descent Parser Problem You need to
        parse text according to a set of grammar rules and perform actions or
        build an abstract syntax tree representing the input. The grammar is
        small, so you’d prefer to just write the parser yourself as opposed to
        using some kind of framework. Solution In this problem, we’re focused on
        the problem of parsing text according to a particular grammar. In order
        to do this, you should probably start by having a formal specification
        of the grammar in the form of a BNF or EBNF. For example, a grammar for
        simple arithmetic expressions might look like this: expr ::= expr + term
        | expr - term | term term ::= term * factor | term / factor | factor
        factor ::= ( expr ) | NUM Or, alternatively, in EBNF form: 2.19. Writing
